# Ex 3: Counting Your Treasure

The boy Santiago was overjoyed! He had found his treasure at last. Burried underneath the Sycamore tree in the old dilapidated church in the wild moors of Spain. Just like he had realized at the end of his long journey that took him through the desert to the Pyramids in Egypt. He now had to create an accurate account of the gold and jewels he had found and estimate their worth. For he had promised to give one tenth of it to a gypsy woman at the border village who had helped him in his journey.

## Coding Exercise

This exercise is going to be little more harder than previous ones, but don't worry. Take it one character and one line at a time. Your patience and focus will reward itself soon.

```elixir
# Treasure Accounting 101


IO.puts "Treasure Under the Sycamore Tree"
IO.puts "--------------------------------"

IO.puts "Number of large gold coins: #{150 + 300 + 350 + 200}" # from four leather bags
IO.puts "Weight of each large gold coin (in ounces): #{2.5}"

# Multiply total number with weight of each large gold coin
IO.puts "Total weight of large gold coins (in ounces): #{ (150 + 300 + 350 + 200) * 2.5 }"

IO.puts "Number of small gold coins: #{500 * 10}" # 500 each in 10 cloth bags
IO.puts "Weight of each small gold coin (in ounces): #{1.5}"
IO.puts "Total weight of small gold coins (in ounces): #{( 500 * 10) * 1.5}"

IO.puts "Total weight of gold (in ounces): #{ ((150 + 300 + 350 + 200) * 2.5) + (( 500 * 10) * 1.5)}"

IO.puts "Weight of one large wooden chest filled with with emeralds (in grams): #{18765}"
IO.puts "Weight of the wooden chest after emptying it (in grams): #{4250}"

# So weight of Emeralds is total weight minus the weight of the empty chest
IO.puts "Hence weight of Emeralds (in grams): #{18765 - 4250}"

IO.puts "Number of grams in an ounce: #{28.3495}"

# Divide number of grams by 28.34952 to get number of ounces
IO.puts "Hence total weight of emeralds (in ounces): #{ (18765 - 4250) / 28.3495  }"

IO.puts "Number of emerald stones: #{256}"
IO.puts "Average weight of each emerald stone (in ounces): #{ ((18765 - 4250) / 28.3495) / 256 }"

IO.puts "--------------------------------"
IO.puts "Number of large gold coins to give to the gypsy woman: #{ (150 + 300 + 350 + 200) / 10 }"
IO.puts "Number of small gold coins to give to the gypsy woman: #{ (500 * 10) / 10 }"
IO.puts "Number of Emerald stones to give to the gypsy woman: #{ 256 / 10 }"

```

## Things to Note

1. Notice that within the string to be printed we have `#{ stuff }`. In this exercise `stuff` is mostly numbers and simple math operators like `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication) and `/` (division).
2. In general `stuff` can be any valid Elixir code that executes and the result is substituted into the string being printed using `IO.puts`
3. You need to take care of precedence of math operations and use brackets ( ) to unambiguously specifiy the math operations. For e.g if you meant to do `(3 + 5) * 3`, typing in `3 + 5 * 3` will give an incorrect result.
4. Complex math expressions can be more easily understood by tackling one small chunk of math enclosed within brackets `( )` at a time. 

## Running and Output

When this code saved in 3.ex file and is run from the command line using `elixir  3.ex` you should see a very similar output as:

```output
Treasure Under the Sycamore Tree
--------------------------------
Number of large gold coins: 1000
Weight of each large gold coin (in ounces): 2.5
Total weight of large gold coins (in ounces): 2.5e3
Number of small gold coins: 5000
Weight of each small gold coin (in ounces): 1.5
Total weight of small gold coins (in ounces): 7.5e3
Total weight of gold (in ounces): 1.0e4
Weight of one large wooden chest filled with with emeralds (in grams): 18765
Weight of the wooden chest after emptying it (in grams): 4250
Hence weight of Emeralds (in grams): 14515
Number of grams in an ounce: 28.3495
Hence total weight of emeralds (in ounces): 512.0019753434805
Number of emerald stones: 256
Average weight of each emerald stone (in ounces): 2.0000077161854706
--------------------------------
Number of large gold coins to give to the gypsy woman: 100.0
Number of small gold coins to give to the gypsy woman: 500.0
Number of Emerald stones to give to the gypsy woman: 25.6
```

## Output Observations

1. If you notice on line 6 of the output, instead of a number we have `2.5e3`. This is what is known as the scientific or exponential notation for numbers. `2.5e3` stands for 2.5 multiplied by 10 raised to 3, which is equal to `2500`. Similarly `7.5e3` is `7500` and `1.0e4` is `10000`.
2. There is a way to ask Elixir to use a particular formatting for numbers in the output. We will figure that out that later.
3. On line 21, Elixir calculated the number of Emerald stones the boy needs to give to the gypsy woman as `25.6`. Since the boy can't really break up an emerald stone and give 25 and 0.6th of a stone to her, we will have to figure something out. Perhaps generously give her 26 emeralds?
4. If you have noticed that it is cumbersome to repeat the same math operations more than once, like on lines 7, 11 and 17 in the code listing, you are right. In the next exercise we will explore a way to make life easier for us.


## Interactive Elixir

1. In point 3 of *Things to Note*, we discussed how when meaning to compute `(3 + 5) * 3`, typing in `3 + 5 * 3` will give an incorrect result. Let us actually try this out.
2. To quickly try things out, Elixir gives us a utility named IEx. IEx stands for "Interactive Elixir" and like the name suggests is Elixir's interactive shell.
3. Type `iex` in a new command line window. Your prompt should change to something similar to `iex(1)`. `1`, `2` and so on are line numbers. 
4.  All you have to do is type in a valid Elixir expression at the `iex` prompt, press enter and the result will be printed just below.

  ```iex
  iex(1)> 3 + 5 * 3
  18
  iex(2)> (3 + 5) * 3
  24
  ```
5. You can type in any valid Elixir expressions in to IEx and it will "read, evaluate and print" the result. IEx is really useful to quickly try out Elixir expressions. We will get to know and use IEx more as we go along. Its a very useful learning tool.
6. Such interactive shells are more generally known in programming world as **REPLs**, *Read Evaluate Print Loops*.
7. If you are curious (and remember curiosity is a highly regarded virtue), you should try out a few more Elixir expressions in the IEx shell at this point. Remember it need not be just math expressions like `3 + 5` etc. You could also try `IO.puts "print something"` in IEx. And don't worry, Elixir will print out helpful error messages in case you get something wrong. This will help you to "**work the problem**".
8. You can exit the IEx shell by typing `Ctr-C` twice.
